This text file will help you to setup limez and to prevent problems that may
occur during installation. Please read it carefully and follow the steps.

!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!

Since i did not completely manage to configure the "make install"- stuff you need
to install the server by executing './install_limez.sh <location> <user> <group>'
after compiling. I would appreciate if someone woud give me some hints about
automake/conf (kdevelop is also involved i guess). 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1 Preparation
=============
1.1 DNS - setup
---------------
In order to install limez, you need to setup a host/ip with an own preferred
MX-record pointing to himself. For example, if you create a host named
'listserv.limez.net', you have to add an own MX 20 for this host. If you're not
familiar with the domain name service, please consult the manuals or RFC's. 

zonefile of limez.net:

listserv         IN A     192.168.2.45
                 IN MX    20 listserv.limez.net

1.2 Interfaces
--------------
Once you have an IP-address, you need to install the interface with ifconfig.
On solaris: 'ifconfig hme0:10 inet 192.168.2.45 up', make sure the interface
is coming up at system boot time. (write IP into /etc/hostname.hme0:10)

1.3 Users/Groups
----------------
In order to listen on the smtp-port (tcp/25), limez needs to be started as
root. After that the user/group set in the 'limez.config' will be used to 
communicate with other MTA's and to access files. This user must be added
to the system (/etc/passwd) and should belong to the given group (/etc/group).

1.4 DNS-Server
--------------
Your system needs to be configured with DNS. The domain name service config
file (/etc/resolv.conf) must contain at least one nameserver, the service-
file (/etc/nsswitch.conf) must contain 'hosts: dns'.

2 Installation
==============
2.1 Source distribution
-----------------------
2.1.1 Extract the distribution
------------------------------
After downloading the source distribution you have to unzip and untar
the package. You will need the gnu tar program and gzip.

> gtar zxvf limez-*.tgz
or
> gzcat limez-*.tgz | tar xvf -

2.1.2 Configure your needs
--------------------------
Limez uses the gnu automake/header/conf. You may see all the available
options by executing:

./configure --help

Usually you just have to type './configure --prefix=<install dir>', 'make'
and 'make install' to build and install limez to the desired location. If
you want database support, you need the additional options:

  --enable-mysql-db       compilation with MySQL database support
  --enable-postgres-db    with postgreSQL database support 
  --enable-msql-db        with Hughes MiniSQL database support (not working)
  --enable-iplanet-ldap   with Netscape IPlanet SDK support
  --enable-open-ldap      with OpenLDAP support

If you use database/ldap support be sure to know where to find the necessary
libs (libmysqlclient.so, libpg.so, libldap.so) and include files. Then you
need to set the environment before starting configure. Suppose you use tcsh,
and MySQL is installed in '/opt/mysql' you would have to type the following:

You may not configure multiple database drivers but database and ldap can 
be used together for different lists.

setenv CPPFLAGS "-R/opt/mysql/lib -L/opt/mysql/lib -I/opt/mysql/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/opt/mysql/lib"

Then you may configure and build limez.

2.1.3 Build and Install
-----------------------
After configuring you just need to call 'gmake' or 'make'. GNU make should be
preferred. Once the compiler has been finished there should be a program 
named limez in the src/ - directory. You can try to start the binary with 
the option '-v'. Limez should tell the version, build date and compiled options:

>./limez -v
Server version :  Limez 1.0-beta-3d (Unix)
Server built   :  Mar  9 2001 10:43:01
Server options :  + file storage support
                  + LDAP support (OpenLDAP 20007)
                  + MySQL database support (3.22.27)

If the desired options are set, just call 'gmake install' or 'make install'.

2.2 Binary distribution
-----------------------
Limez actually can be installed wherever you like. If you want to install
limez in /www/apps/limez you should go to /www/apps and untar the package.

> gtar zxvf limez-x-x-x-x.tar.gz

Now we need to set the user/group of the complete limez-dir: 

> chown -R limez:limez /www/apps/limez
> chmod g+s /www/apps/limez

2.3 Editing the limez - mainconfig 'limez.config'
-------------------------------------------------
First of all, you should edit the 'server_domain' to the domain you set up
before. Set the 'server_host' and 'server_send_host' to the IP/DNS-name of your
interface (the machine's IP-Address). Just configure one simple list (test)
for testing purposes. Try using a file-list rather than database because it's
easier to set up.

2.4 Starting limez
------------------
Limez must be started as super-user. After config changes you should let limez test
the configuration syntax by running 'limez -t'. You will see all configuration
entries (mainconfig and all configured mailinglists). Furthermore, limez tells
you if any parameter could not be understood. If no errors occur, you
can run limez without parameters. Now you can check the listen on the given
interface by calling:

> netstat -an | grep LISTEN | grep 25
tcp        0      0 192.168.0.3:25            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

As you see here a process is listening on the IP 192.168.0.3 port 25.
Another way to check if limez is running is to use the telnet program:

bender> telnet bender 25
Trying 192.168.0.3...
Connected to bender.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 bender.limez.net SMTP Limez 1.0; Sun, 18 Feb 2001 15:51:52 -0800
helo x
250 bender.limez.net Hello bender.limez.net [192.168.0.3], pleased to meet you
quit
221 bender.limez.net closing connection
Connection closed by foreign host.
bender>

The output should be similar. Please check if both hosts have been resolved
correctly (the line beginning with 250 before and after 'Hello').

2.5 First steps
---------------
Send an e-mail to 'server_name'@'server_domain' with 'help' as body. Limez
should generate an answer-mail and send it within 10 secs. Add yourself to the
test-list by sending 'add test' to limez. Send a broadcast mail to
test@'server_domain'.

2.6 Start/Stop script
---------------------
You will find the limez start/stop script in the directory 'scripts'. Just
copy this script to /etc/init.d/limez and link it to /etc/rc3.d/S88limez
to start on system boot and /etc/rc0.d/K30limez to stop limez on shutdown.
This only works on SYS/5 (Solaris/Linux) this way, on BSD-Unix (e.g. FreeBSD)
you need to edit the file /etc/rc(.local).

2.7 Limez Administrator
-----------------------
The limez package also contains a nice web-frontend called the limez admin.
You need to install a webserver which can handle PHP >= 4.0 (e.g. apache + php4)
(may be downloaded here: http://www.apache.org http://www.php.net).

You have to copy the 'admin' directory from the limez distribution to the 
document root of the webserver. This directory contains the config file 
'limez.ini' where the necessary connection parameters have to be changed.

$limez_host = "192.168.0.3";
--> has to be the same as the key 'server_host' in the limez main config

$limez_port = "25";
--> has to be the same as the key 'server_port' in the limez main config

$limez_pass = "admin";
--> has to be the same as the key 'server_web_pass' in the limez main config

If the administrating webserver runs on another machine you need to add another
key 'server_web_hosts' containing the IP address of the webserver machine
in the limez main config. If you use database main config (server_config 'database')
and the IP would be '192.168.0.4' you need to start limez this way:

./limez -s server_web_hosts 192.168.0.4

3 Database
==========
3.1 Creating MySQL Database User/DB
-----------------------------------
Log into the DB with admin rights and create a database for limez (create
database limez). Now we need to add a user for this db (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
ON limez.* TO limez@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'secret677'). If the listserver is
running on another host you need to exchange 'localhost' by the hostname or
IP limez is running on.

3.2 Creating postgres Database User/DB
--------------------------------------
please refer to the postgres documentation.

3.3 Database Tables
-------------------
On startup limez checks the db for the config/sender/user tables. If 
the necessary tables do not exist, they will be created automatically.

limez uses the following tables:

limezconfig - the config for the server and the lists
limezsender - all the people who are allowed to send to list (if set in config)
<listname>  - for every list there is a table containing the users

If the listname contains special characters (like '-' or '.' which are allowed
as listname) but not as database tables, you would have to set the list key
'list_usertable_name' in listconfig.

3.4 Configuration
-----------------

db_host       - hostname used to connect to the database server, if not set,
                the database clients try to connect via Unix named socket 
                rather than TCP/IP. You may specify the symbolic name or IP
                the DB server is running on

db_name       - name of the database should be used (selected) while connecting
                to the DB server. Some databases allow default databases for
                every user but this option is mandatory here. A database server
                may host different databases, so you need to tell limez.

db_user       - username used to authenticate, some database server do not require
                user/password sign on but for security reasons it is indispensible.

db_pass       - the password for 'db_user', some database server may accept user
                with empty passwords but please set one ...

list_usertable_name - as you read in chapter 3.3 limez uses the 'list_name' as
                      default name of the user table. In some cases this may not
                      work so you can change the tablename here. This is also
                      a good way to have different lists with the same users

3.5 DB Config Example
---------------------
server config
-------------
server_config database
db_host       bender
db_name       limezdb
db_user       lmiezuser
db_pass       secretpw

list config
-----------
list_name        test
list_user_source database

4. LDAP
=======
The newest version of limez supports the storage of user and sender in
the LDAP Directory Server. Limez may be compiled to support the OpenLDAP
library (www.openldap.org) and Netscape Iplanet Directory Server SDK
(www.iplanet.com).

4.1 Basics
----------
You can tell limez the 'list_user_source' and/or 'list_sender_source' is
'ldap'. Furthermore you need to specify 'ldap_hosts' and 'ldap_base_dn' to
get LDAP working. The default filter expects that the users are member
of the given group. The group must match the following criteria.

1. must be located under 'ldap_base_dn'.
2. must have the objects 'groupofuniquenames' and 'mailgroup' if you use
   the default filter
3. must have the attribute 'cn=<groupname>'
4. contains references to the members of the group 'uniquemember'

Limez now knows all distinguished names of the users and looks them up
'sn', 'givenname' and 'mail'. The attribute 'mail' will be used as the
e-mail address of the user.

4.2 Configuration
-----------------
The following keys are used to access the ldap directory:

ldap_hosts   - host(s) where the ldap-server is running on, you may add 
               hosts separated by space. If the server is not running on
               the default port 389, you have to specify 'host:port'

ldap_base_dn - the distinguished name is the base for all searches

ldap_user    - username used to authenticate to the directory server, if not set,
               anonymous bind will be performed

ldap_pass    - password used to authenticate to the directory server, if not set,
               anonymous bind will be performed

list_ldap_user_group   - the groupname where to get the user from, if not set,
                         the listname will be used as group here

list_ldap_sender_group - the groupname where to get the sender from, if not set,
                         the listname will be used as group here

ldap_filter  - search filter used to get the groups, if not set, the default filter 
               '(objectclass=groupofuniquenames)(objectclass=mailgroup)' will be
               used. The group and the filter will be added '(&(cn=<group>)<filter>)'

Currently only read operations are performed, no user/sender may be added or
deleted in the LDAP Storage. Storing the limez/list configuration is NOT supported
yet, you should use a database here.

4.3 LDAP Config Example
-----------------------
server config
-------------
ldap_hosts       "bender fry:390"
ldap_base_dn     o=limez.net

list config
-----------
list_name            test
list_user_source     ldap
list_ldap_user_group champs

5 Hints/Warnings
================
- please change the limez admin password 'server_web_pass' in the main config,
  use at least 8 characters

- for security reasons please do not let limez children run as superuser.
  Set 'server_uid' and 'server_gid' in mainconfig. You will have to chown
  the limez root dir to this user:group

- if limez creates the logfile 'limez.log' as root (on start) and then drops
  privileges the processes may not be able to access (write) the logfile
  anymore, be sure the directory-permissions are set correctly (775)

- if you are using the limez chroot()- environment ('limez_root') (security
  feature), you have to create a new etc - directory containing those files
  under the directory 'limez_root' is set to. (/etc/resolv.conf etc.)

- do not let limez listen on all interfaces (default), set 'server_host'
  and 'server_send_host' to the IP you set up for the listserver to prevent
  confusion of other MTA's and problems with other MTA's running on the same
  machine

- if using database mainconfig ('server_config "database"') you can add/change
  the configuration by applying '-s <key> <value>' as command line parameter.
  After changing the config (e.g. changing values in the limez admin) the new
  value will be stored in database config permanently

- some main config keys are only temporarily and are not written to the config-
  file/table, they have to be added with '-s <key> <value>' as option every time
  limez starts (e.g. 'server_daemonize' or 'debug_test_only')

- if you are using the web-frontend limez admin please protect the location with
  password/IP (otherwise anybody may change the config)

---
If you experience problems with db/ldap-access/limez config, the FAQ 
(http://www.limez.net/) may be helpful. If this still can't solve
your problems then send an e-mail to support@limez.net (please attach the log-
file with 'debug_level 9' and the output of 'limez -t', preferrable with-
out passwords ;)).
